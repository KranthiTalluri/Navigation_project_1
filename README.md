# Project 1: Navigation

### Introduction

For this project, you will train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.  

![Trained Agent][image1]

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)

2. Place the file in the course GitHub repository, in the `Navigation_project_1/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file. 

### Instructions

1. All the required dependencies can be installed using requirement.yml
2. Create the conda environment where myenv is the name of the environment  

    **`conda env create --name myenv --file=requirement.yml`**
3. Activate the conda environment
   
    **`conda activate myenv`** 

4. After activating the environment, follow the instructions in `Navigation.ipynb` to get started with training your own agent!.

Execute the all the cells and now you will be able to see the agent is trained. This trained agent will collecting the yellow bananas while avoiding the blue bananas. Model architectural changes can be done in model.py file and agent hyperparameter tuning can be done in dqn_agent.py file.
